To start, we will generate a random integer between 1 and 20, and based on
the result of the random number, we check to see if it fall under certain range
if the number is greater than 15 , then the results will be "cherries"
otherwise if the number is > 10, the result will be "Orange"
otherwise if the number is > 5, the result will be "Plum"
otherwise if the number is > 2, the result will be "Melon"
otherwise if the number is > 1, the result will be "Bell"
if the result is not any of the above, the result will be "bar"

we iterate over using a loop three times and print the results to the user. As an example
"Plum, cherries, Melon'
